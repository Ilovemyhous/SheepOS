# SheepOS XFCE 64bit - Distro for the Render Farm Client

## Overview

SheepOS is a very lightweight Distro based on Porteus / Slackware for the free and distributed render farm [SheepIt](https://www.sheepit-renderfarm.com).

### Versions

This is the XFCE version, you can find the CLI version [here](https://github.com/zocker-160/SheepitOS/tree/CLI).

## Usage

 - Download the ISO and extract it (e.g. with Ark or 7zip) to a FAT32 formatted USB drive.
 - Boot from it
 - enjoy xD
 
### System requirements

 - min. 2GB RAM, the more the better ;)

## Building the ISO

//TODO

## Adding own modules (e.g. nvidia-drivers)

//TODO

## Notes

- This distro supports only CPU rendering for now.
- If you use the *copy2RAM* option, you can unplug the boot media after the distro had booted.

## Issues/ToDo

[ ] Make that you simply need to burn the ISO, instead of extracting it.
